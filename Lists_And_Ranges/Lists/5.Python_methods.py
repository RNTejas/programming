"""
A method is the same as the function,except that it's bound to an object
That means we need an object, in order to call a Method
When we call a method, we tell it which object it's called on.(Which object it is using to perform a task)

s.append(x)
means that will be appending x to a list called s.
we pass x as an argument, so that the knows what to append
